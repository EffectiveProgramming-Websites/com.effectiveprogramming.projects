title: Jekyll Kanban Board
active: true

<p>While tools like <a href="http://www.leankit.com">Lean Kit</a> and <a href="http://www.kanbanize.com">Kanbanize</a> are certainly effective implementations of a Kanban board, I'm technical and want more control, more flexibility, less expensive and simpler. My first attempt at this is to create a Kanban board over the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> platform.</p>

<p>It isn't a gem or <em>downloadable</em> per se as much as it is simply an example of one way to use Jekyll. It lives perpetually in all of my projects and honestly, it will likely differ between instances as I explore different ways to leverage Jekyll.</p>
