title: Introducing the Jekyll Kanban Board
---

I've published an example of how I'm using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to realize a Kanban board. I am using the [gh-pages](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/) capability to github to do this. Basically, I created a ```gh_pages``` branch in an unrelated project [Kanban Tool](https://github.com/FuzzyBearings/Kanban-Tool) and keep the pages in that branch. Github recognizes this branch and publishes them publicly for me.

In case it isn't obvious, _Kanban Tool_ is actually an iOS project I am working on and not directly related to the Kanban board I am demonstrating. I know it is confusing. I wouldn't mind documenting this a bit more in the future but I have no idea how many people would find value in that so I thought I'd post this now and see what kind of response I get.

## TL;DR

- [Github](https://github.com/FuzzyBearings/Kanban-Tool)
- [Kanban Tool](http://fuzzybearings.github.io/Kanban-Tool/index.html)
